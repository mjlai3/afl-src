Please also see below with some general tips about the challenge, as well as feedback from the guys at AFL about people who previously failed the test.

 

Please put your absolute all into it, as if successful, your next interview with the AFL will be largely based on the coding challenge itself.

 

Although there was some nice visual style to it, there was very little demonstration of responsive design knowledge which is a large component of the work we do. The project also contained a lot of unnecessary boilerplate assets.

 

Please ensure the code is simple, production ready, structured, and well documented (with maximum test coverage).

 

Please also refer below with some more tips and advice for the test:

-          Ensure that you utilise TDD; there must be maximum test coverage

-          Demonstration of OOP patterns (which show a solid understanding of fundamentals of Software Development)

-          Well defined classes

-          Ensure there are no bugs; ie, the test doesnâ€™t fail!

-          Please ensure the code works as specified

-          Ensure that the tests are not very complex or hard to read

-          Ensure you attempt to model the domain

-          Avoid having multiple assertions per test

-          Make sure the solution is test driven, and you exercise as close to perfect test coverage

-          Avoid code duplications
